## Working Experiences 
### Full Stack Engineer @ Marfeel (Currently)

In my 2+ years I’ve covered different roles in several teams, aligned with my seniority path. The opportunity of working as a Product Engineer on projects that impacts millions of people have taught me to take responsibility and ownership of every line of code I ship in production. I had the chance to work both in internal projects as well as directly with the clients. I’m part of the dev team that is in charge of starting up a brand new product for the company. This meant that I had to expand my skill set from front-end to backend as well as DevOps technologies. I collaborated in setting up the build systems and the “go-to-production” workflow using Jenkins. I assisted in the design and maintenance of the core architecture of the project, as well as evangelising the introduction of new technologies in the company stack such as VueJS.

### CEO & Co Founder @ Piece of Italy

”Piece of Italy” was a food startup that I founded together with friends. The aim was to provide and deliver the authentic Italian food together with it’s culture, in an accessible and comfortable way. The product consisted mainly on delivering a food box with pre-dosed ingredients and an easy-to-follow video-recipe. We had the chance to experiment all the steps required for a startup building, from a Business Plan to an eventual CrowdFounding campaign. I learnt the importance of team-working and team efforts for a common goal, business practices, communication and networking skills. It was a very fruitful experience useful to benchmark my leadership & entrepreneurial skills

### Software Engineer Internship @ Buildo

My main goal at build was learning. Here I had the possibility to experiment cutting edge technologies such as ReactJS, Redux and Docker. The company value was strongly related to open source so I was able to create and publish my work on several ReactJS Components used internally for project of huge dimension. I also had to do a small security audit of the internal softwares, and i was involved in the design of a simplified version of OAuth for an internal requirement

### Junior Software Engineer @ Settle

I joined this early stage startup as a solo developer. I was entirely responsible of the product development along the CEO//CTO. I implemented RESTful APIs using Spring, I also maintained an AngularJS dashboard used by the clients as a back-office. My main challenge was to implement an SSO architecture, and the integration of various payment systems. I took care of the MongoDB database as well as the first rudimental CI//CD to deploy and ship the product. I had a first overview on Docker and RabbitMQ.

### Junior Software Engineer @ Bhuman

This was my first professional job, the first three months I was trained and I fulfilled courses of AngularJS, JSP, Java & Hibernate. In this consultancy company I had the chance to take part in different projects, one of the which included an extensive AngularJS project for Ericsson. I also had to work directly in Bash on top of a framework created internally by our team, always keeping in mind dependencies management and OS compatibility since the software had to run stand-alone as well as in Unix-like than in Solaris & FreeBSD machines.

## Education
###  BD in Computer Science @ Università degli Studi di Milano
Since the beginning of my Bachelor Degree studies in Computer Science at the University of Milan (UNIMI), I combined working and studying. At the end of the second year, I was already working as a Software Developer.
